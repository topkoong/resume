    "bio":"I am a 25-year-old coder, movie buff, computer engineer from Bangkok, Thailand, and I am chiefly interested in technology. You will also see from my resume that I am a graduate student in the Computer Engineering program at Syracuse University. I have experience with cyber security, vulnerability assessment, infrastructure penetration testing, and server configuration review at Deloitte as an IT analyst in the cyber security department. I also am proficient in web development, using a MEAN stack, MERN stack, or ASP.NET, which is a collection of JavaScript-based technologies (MongoDB, Express.js, Angularjs2/React.js, and Node.js) or a set of technologies in the Microsoft .NET Framework used to develop web applications. The followings are examples of my React URL that I build from scratch: http://strawberry-custard-81818.herokuapp.com/, https://agile-castle-91250.herokuapp.com/, and http://shielded-earth-69097.herokuapp.com/. My GitHub repo is the following: github.com/topkoong/. In addition, I held a part-time position as a systems operator during my undergraduate career at Pragma Technology Co., Ltd. While working there, I monitored networks to maintain integrity, as well as ensured security, network connectivity, and availability to specific users. Similarly, I deployed and configured servers by applying OS patches and upgrades on a regular basis, in addition to upgrading administrative tools and utilities. Furthermore, I maintained network servers such as intrusion detection system, intrusion prevention system, and system efficiency. I believe that my focus and productivity will be a great asset to your company. I have exceptional problem-solving skills, a methodical approach, and excellent attention to detail. I perform well when faced with strict deadlines and am also an effective communicator who works well with others.",

In addition, you are able to record your special events, normal events, and thoughts and feelings. This is a kind of therapy after bad days given that you can understand things you could have done better thereby assessing your mistakes when writing something down and considering it. In addition, you are able to appreciate your success by writing down a challenge you overcame and how you did it. Functions of this application software are to perform specific operations for the convenience of users such as adding or editing diary, getting user’s current location, finding titles by keyword, recording audio as well as sharing their stories to social media eg. Twitter and Facebook. To implement this project, we used CoreData, AVAFoundation, MapKit, CoreLocation Framework, ImagePicker, and Social Framework, and Model View Controller pattern in this application.",

Afterward, the system will notify the user via email. The email itself will consist of the photo from the webcam and the date and the time of the photo captured. In conclusion, the project will send a photo to the user when a door is opened.",
